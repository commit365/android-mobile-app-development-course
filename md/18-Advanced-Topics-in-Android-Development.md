# Lesson 18: Advanced Topics in Android Development

In this lesson, we will explore advanced concepts in Android development, including Kotlin Multiplatform, Jetpack Compose, and Dependency Injection with Hilt. We will also discuss popular architectural patterns such as MVVM, MVP, and Clean Architecture, along with best practices for scalable app design.

## 1. Overview of Advanced Concepts

### Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) allows developers to share code between different platforms, such as Android, iOS, web, and backend. This enables you to write common business logic once and use it across multiple platforms, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

#### Key Features of Kotlin Multiplatform

- **Shared Codebase**: Write common code in a shared module that can be used by different platform-specific modules.
- **Platform-Specific Implementations**: Use expect/actual declarations to implement platform-specific functionality.
- **Gradle Integration**: KMP integrates with Gradle, making it easy to manage dependencies and build configurations.

### Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for building native Android UIs using a declarative approach. It simplifies UI development by allowing developers to describe the UI in Kotlin code rather than XML.

#### Key Features of Jetpack Compose

- **Declarative UI**: Build UIs by describing how they should look based on the current state.
- **Composable Functions**: Create reusable UI components using composable functions.
- **Live Previews**: Preview your UI components in Android Studio without running the app.
- **Material Design Support**: Built-in support for Material Design components.

### Dependency Injection with Hilt

Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the process of managing dependencies in your app. It is built on top of Dagger and integrates seamlessly with the Android framework.

#### Key Features of Hilt

- **Simplified DI Setup**: Hilt provides a set of annotations to simplify the setup of dependency injection.
- **Automatic Component Generation**: Hilt generates the necessary components and modules for dependency injection at compile time.
- **Lifecycle Awareness**: Hilt automatically manages the lifecycle of dependencies based on Android components (e.g., Activities, Fragments).

## 2. Understanding Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns help organize your code and separate concerns, making your app easier to maintain and scale. Here are three popular architectural patterns used in Android development:

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

MVVM is an architectural pattern that separates the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model). 

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Displays the UI and observes changes in the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, holding UI-related data and handling user interactions.

#### Example of MVVM

```kotlin
class UserViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val userRepository = UserRepository()
    val user: LiveData<User> = userRepository.getUser()

    fun updateUser(user: User) {
        userRepository.updateUser(user)
    }
}
```

### MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

MVP is another architectural pattern that separates the presentation layer from the UI. 

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays the UI and forwards user interactions to the Presenter.
- **Presenter**: Handles the presentation logic and interacts with the Model to update the View.

#### Example of MVP

```kotlin
interface UserView {
    fun showUser(user: User)
}

class UserPresenter(private val view: UserView) {
    private val userRepository = UserRepository()

    fun loadUser(userId: Int) {
        val user = userRepository.getUser(userId)
        view.showUser(user)
    }
}
```

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns and independence of frameworks, UI, and data sources. It consists of several layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components and interacts with the Use Cases.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and Use Cases.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources (e.g., network, database).

#### Example of Clean Architecture

```kotlin
// Domain Layer
class GetUserUseCase(private val userRepository: UserRepository) {
    fun execute(userId: Int): User {
        return userRepository.getUser(userId)
    }
}

// Presentation Layer
class UserViewModel(private val getUserUseCase: GetUserUseCase) : ViewModel() {
    val user: LiveData<User> = MutableLiveData()

    fun loadUser(userId: Int) {
        user.value = getUserUseCase.execute(userId)
    }
}
```

## 3. Best Practices for Scalable App Design

To ensure your app is scalable and maintainable, consider the following best practices:

### Use Dependency Injection

Utilize Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks like Hilt to manage dependencies and improve testability. DI helps decouple components and makes it easier to swap implementations.

### Follow SOLID Principles

Adhere to the SOLID principles of object-oriented design to create modular and maintainable code:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

### Keep UI and Business Logic Separate

Maintain a clear separation between UI code and business logic by using architectural patterns like MVVM or Clean Architecture. This separation makes it easier to test and maintain your app.

### Write Unit and UI Tests

Regularly write unit tests and UI tests to ensure the correctness of your code. Use testing frameworks like JUnit, Espresso, and MockK to automate testing and catch issues early.

### Optimize Performance

Continuously monitor and optimize the performance of your app using tools like Android Profiler. Focus on memory management, efficient layouts, and background processing to enhance user experience.
